# Пересказ 

Malware and cybercrime have become significant threats in the digital age, requiring users to understand and implement protective measures. Malware, such as viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and keyloggers, is designed to disrupt systems or steal sensitive information. Viruses attach themselves to host programs and replicate when activated, while worms are standalone programs that spread across networks without user intervention. Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software but often open backdoors for unauthorized access. Ransomware encrypts data and demands payment for its release, causing financial and operational damage.

Spyware collects personal information without the user's consent, and keyloggers record keystrokes to steal sensitive data like passwords. Adware displays unwanted advertisements, while phishing tricks users into revealing confidential information through fake emails or websites. Other forms of cybercrime include website defacement, which alters a site's appearance, and salami shaving, where small amounts of money are stolen from numerous accounts over time.

Viruses often remain dormant until triggered by specific events, such as executing a host program. They can include misdirection routines to hide their presence, reproduction routines to spread to other files, triggers to activate payloads at specific times, and payloads that cause damage or display messages. Unlike viruses, worms do not require activation and can self-replicate rapidly across networks.

Preventing malware involves using strong passwords, avoiding suspicious downloads or email attachments, and regularly updating antivirus software. Understanding the anatomy of malware and its mechanisms is essential for protecting systems from these evolving threats.
