## Task 1. Lead-in questions

**1. What highly demanded IT jobs in Russia can you name?**
Currently, the most in-demand IT jobs in Russia include: software developers (Java, Python, C\#), frontend and backend developers, mobile app developers (Android/iOS), DevOps engineers, data scientists, cybersecurity specialists, cloud architects, QA engineers, and product managers. These positions are particularly sought after due to digital transformation and the growing tech sector.

**2. What IT jobs used to be popular but don't rank high anymore?**
Some IT jobs that were popular but have declined include: Flash developers (due to Flash being discontinued), basic web designers (replaced by UX/UI designers), hardware technicians (due to cloud migration), traditional database administrators (automated by cloud services), and basic system administrators (replaced by DevOps and cloud specialists).

**3. How do you see your future employment in the field of IT upon graduation?**
As an Android developer with skills in Java, Kotlin, Python, and Dart, I see myself starting as a junior mobile developer, then progressing to senior Android developer, and potentially moving into cross-platform development or technical leadership roles. The mobile development market continues to grow, offering excellent career prospects.
