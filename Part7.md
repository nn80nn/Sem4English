## Task 3. Turing Test Questions

**1. When was the idea of the Turing Test first introduced?**
The Turing Test was first introduced in 1950 by Alan Turing in his paper where he proposed "The Imitation Game"[^3].

**2. What is the procedure that the Turing Test involves?**
The test involves two contestants (one human and one computer) and a judge. The judge asks questions to both contestants and tries to determine which is human and which is machine. If the judge's accuracy is less than 50%, it suggests the computer is a good simulation of human intelligence[^1][^3].

**3. What were Turing's predictions for how computers would do on the test in the future?**
Turing believed that in about fifty years' time, it would be possible to program computers with sufficient storage capacity to play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator would not have more than 70% chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning[^3].

**4. What was the name of the first program claimed to have passed the Turing test?**
Based on the text, ELIZA and PARRY were early programs that revealed potential problems with the test[^1].

**5. What potential problems with the test did the success of ELIZA and PARRY reveal?**
These programs showed that machines could deceive humans without truly understanding, revealing that passing the test might not necessarily indicate genuine intelligence or understanding[^1].

**6. How did Eugene Goostman manage to deceive the judges?**
The specific details about Eugene Goostman's deception methods are not provided in the search results.

## Task 4. Fill in the gaps

1. **ahead** - Alan Turing was much ahead of his time
2. **coined** - the term Artificial Intelligence was not even coined
3. **suggested** - he suggested an idea called 'The Imitation Game'
4. **contestants** - there would be two contestants
5. **human** - decide which is a human
6. **emerged** - Since the concept of AI emerged
7. **focus** - an excessive focus on developing HLAI
8. **dependent** - become increasingly dependent on those who control technology
9. **retain** - humans retain control

**Перевод:** Алан Тьюринг, человек, который намного опережал свое время, начал размышлять о том, могут ли машины думать. В 1950 году, когда компьютеры только появились, а термин "искусственный интеллект" еще не был придуман, Алан уже думал о том, может ли машина думать как человек. В 1950 году Алан Тьюринг опубликовал статью, в которой предложил идею или тест под названием "Игра в имитацию", сегодня известную как тест Тьюринга.

## Task 5. Text A Questions

**1. In what way is an artificial neural network similar to biological brain?**
Artificial neural networks simulate the work of the biological brain by creating densely interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) that can learn and make decisions in a humanlike way[^1].

**2. What tasks can be accomplished by neural networks?**
Neural networks can accomplish face recognition, autonomous driving, generating realistic CGI faces, machine translation, fraud detection, classification, clustering, and prediction tasks[^1].

**3. What is the difference between classification and clustering?**
Classification involves classifying data sets into predefined classes, while clustering involves classifying data into different undefined categories[^1].

**4. How are units arranged in a fully-connected neural network?**
In a fully-connected neural network, each unit in one layer is connected to every unit in another layer, with connections represented by weights that can be positive or negative[^1].

**5. What is backpropagation?**
Backpropagation is a feedback process where the network compares its output with the intended output and uses the difference to modify the weights of connections, working backward from output units through hidden units to input units[^1].

**6. Why are neural networks compared to 'black boxes'?**
Neural networks are called 'black boxes' because users feed in data and receive answers, but don't have access to the exact decision-making process[^1].

**7. What problems do professionals come across when working with artificial neural networks?**
The main challenges are the amount of time it takes to train networks and the "black box" nature where the decision-making process is not transparent[^1].
