### **Task 10. Read text C on data encryption**

**a) Data encryption solutions**
**b) Challenges to contemporary encryption**
**c) A definition of data encryption**
**d) The primary functions of data encryption**

**Questions:**

1. Data encryption is the process of converting readable data into an unreadable format to protect it from unauthorized access.
2. Ciphertext is the encrypted, unreadable version of data.
3. ‘Cryptography’ means ‘secret writing’.
4. A cryptographic key is a string of bits used to encrypt and decrypt data.
5. Symmetric and asymmetric (public key) encryption.
6. Symmetric uses one key for both encryption and decryption; asymmetric uses a pair (public and private keys).
7. Encryption guarantees confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.
